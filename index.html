		    <br /><br />
			I grew up with a computer in hands but it's after a year in chemistry, where I found that wasn't for me, that I started to learn computer science at the university.
			After that, I became more and more passionated by this domain. Understand how a computer works and create programs from nothing pleased me.
			<br /><br />
			But I want to do more, I want to learn more than just a Master degree can teach me, I want to discover new things. That's why I choosed to do a PhD. But I still have one year in Master before.
